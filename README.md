## Project Overview

This project showcases end-to-end data analysis capabilities using MySQL that features a fictional e-commerce business, **TechMart**. The analysis covers customer behavior, sales performance, inventory management, and employee analytics. Through this, I've extracted insights that drives strategic business decisions, optimize operations, and enhance customer experience.

### Key Business Questions Answered:
- Which products generate the highest profit margins?
- Who are our most valuable customers and what drives their purchasing behavior?
- How do seasonal trends impact our sales performance?
- Which inventory items require immediate attention for restocking?
- What is the ROI of our product launches by year?
